 The project involves the development of various Bayesian classifiers for continuous random variables

Project

• Build a Bayes classifier function which takes a training dataset, a class
label vector for the training dataset and a test dataset and returns a
class label vector for the test dataset. Assume that the features are
continuous random variables and estimate the multivariate probability
density function by using a multivariate kernel density estimator.

• Build a na¨ıve Bayes classifier function by assuming that the features
are continuous and independent random variables. Use a univariate
kernel density estimator to estimate the probability density function of
each feature.

• Build a na¨ıve Bayes classifier function by assuming that the features are
continuous, independent and Gaussian distributed random variables
with mean µj and variance σj2.

• Compute and compare the average accuracy of the previous classifiers
by applying it to the Iris dataset taking for each class label 50% of
the rows as training dataset and the remaining 50% of the rows as test
dataset
